# Linear Regression Model for Predicting House Prices

This repository contains code for building a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features such as living area, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `train.csv`. The dataset includes the following features:

- `GrLivArea`: Above ground living area in square feet.
- `BedroomAbvGr`: Number of bedrooms above ground.
- `FullBath`: Number of full bathrooms above ground.
- `SalePrice`: The sale price of the house (target variable).

## Installation

To run this code, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
